# [239. Sliding Window Maximum](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/)

#### Description:

You are given an array of integers `nums`, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the `max sliding window`.


#### Understanding:

Given an interger array, return top k frequent elements in any order

	Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
	Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
	
	Explanation: 
	Window position                Max
	---------------               -----
	[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
	 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
	 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 	 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 	 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
	 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7


#### Approach - Brutal Force `O(N*k) O(k)`:

- Loop through the array, to retrieve the largest value inside nums[i : i +k]
	- as i starts from 0, we need to 


#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
      
        res = []
        
        for i in range(len(nums) - k + 1):
            res.append(max(nums[i : i + k]))
                       
        return res
```


#### Approach - Brutal Force `O(N) O(k)`:

To solve the problem, we need to maintain a `k-size window` while picking `the largest element` inside the window.

- hq does not work b/c inside hq, we cannot maintain the window easily

- think what kind of data structure best fits this problem
	- while we move the index to the right, while we locate the current maxium
	- a monotatic decreasing `stack/queue` can serve the second need 
		- `stack[0]` or `queue[0]` is the largetst
	- we pick `queue` instead of stack 
		- as queue `leftpop()` can perfectly mimic the sliding window moves the left pointer down
		- to meet the second need, inside the queue
			- maintain a decreasing monotatic queue. `queue[0]` is the largest in the valid sliding window
			- we only `popleft()` when `queue[0]` is not valid (outside the window)
			- queue needs to append every `i` 
				- b/c althrough the current num is smaller than any nums inside queue, it can still be the largest in the future. Append each element inside queue at least once. The elements get bumped outside queue only when they are smaller inside the current valid sliding windowl. If we do not append every element, we are getting rid of the future possible answers.




#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        
        res = []
        q = deque()
        
        N = len(nums)
        
        if N < k: return res
        
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            
            #  1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7   --> k = 3, i == 3, remove q[0] == 0 
            #  1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7   --> k = 3, i == 4, remove q[0] == 1
            if q and q[0] <= i - k: q.popleft()
            
            while q and nums[q[-1]] <= num: q.pop()
            
            # if not q: # wrong. append every i into q
            q.append(i)
            #print(q) # if not marked off when submitting, it triggers output limitation error 
            
            if i >= k - 1: res.append(nums[q[0]])
                
        return res
