# [242. Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)

#### Description:

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and false otherwise.

An `Anagram` is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

#### Understanding:

Given two strs, see if they are anagram. Quickly check if one char exists in another str, hash is one of the most common approach.

#### Approach:

- As knowing the size (len == 26) this hash could be, we can use array to implement a hash.
- For one str, we add; for the other char, we deduct.
- Loop through hash, if hash value/ array element is not equal to 0, means False else True

    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        
        # before running the algo
        if len(s) != len(t): return False
        
        """using array to implement a hashmap with a certain/known length"""
        
        arr = [0] * 26
        
        # same length
        for i in range(len(s)):
            arr[ord(s[i]) - ord('a')] += 1
            arr[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1
            
            
        for item in arr:
            if item != 0: return False
        return True
