# [349. Intersection of Two Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/)


#### Description:

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be `unique` and you may return the result in `any order`.

#### Understanding:

In two arrays, find the same numbers but only return the unique ones.

#### Approach:

- It is a good question to use hashset 
- It can use array as a hashmap for the largest value is given
- set operations
	- diffence in update and add
	- difference in remove and discard
	- `&`, `-` and etc. 


### Python `O(N) O(N)`
```python
class Solution:
    def intersection(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        """general solutions to all languages"""
        
        hashset = set(nums1)
        
        res = set()
        for num in nums2:
            if num in hashset: res.add(num)
        return res
