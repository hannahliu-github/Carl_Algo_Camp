# [202. Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/)

#### Description:

Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

- TC:
	- Input: n = 19
	- Output: true
	- Explanation:
	- 12 + 92 = 82
	- 82 + 22 = 68
	- 62 + 82 = 100
	- 12 + 02 + 02 = 1

#### Understanding:

Given a number, keep adding up the square of its digits to see if it can be 1. 

Three scenarios:

- it eventually gets to 1.
- it eventually gets stuck in a cycle.
- it keeps going higher and higher, up towards infinity.
	- if `n` contains 1 digit, the largest num will be 9, and the next `n` is 81
	- if `n` contains 2 digits, the largest num will be 99, and the next `n` is 162
	- if `n` contains 3 digits, the largest num will be 999, and the next `n` is 243
	- if `n` contains 4 digits, the largest num will be 9999, and the next `n` is 324
	
		- for n with 3 digits, it will only cycle in range up to 243;
		- for n with 4 and more digits, the next `n` will lose a digit until they are down to 3 digits;
		- we conclude it will never fall into the third scenario.

#### Approach:

If the sum repeats, it cannot be a happy number:

- use hash to detect if repeat


### Python `O(logN) O(logN)`
```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        
        num = n
        hashset = set()
        
        while num != 1:
            
            total = 0
            for digit in str(num):
                total += int(digit) ** 2

            if total == 1: break 

            print(total)
            
            if total not in hashset:
                hashset.add(total)
                num = total

            else:
                return False
            
        return True
        
        
# TC O(logN) b/c we are processing each digit in the number, and the number of digits in a number is given by logN.
# SC O(logN) similar to TC. If n has less than 4 digits. N <= 243 and most likely can be treated as O(1). Otherwise O(logN) as we process each digit in the number, the number of digits in a numebr is given by logN.
