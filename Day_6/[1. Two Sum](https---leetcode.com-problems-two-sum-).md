# [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)


#### Description:

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have `exactly one solution`, and you `may not use the same element twice`.

You can return the answer in any order.

#### Understanding:

- In one array, find the indecies of two numbers add up to the target. 
- Note do not use number repeatly (do not use one number and add it with itself, ask about it to the interviewer). 
- Note this question asks to return any two indecies once find the combinations that add up to target. If we would like to find all combinations, use approach in 454. 4 Sum II.

#### Approach:

- initialize a hashmap
- for each element inside the array
	- if the element in the hashmap, we return indecies
	- if not, we add `hash[target - num]: this num's index`

### Python `O(N) O(N)`
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        
        d = defaultdict()
        
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            
            if num in d: return [d[num], i]
            
            d[target - num] = i
            
        return []
```
