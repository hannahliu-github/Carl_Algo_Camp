# [455. Assign Cookies](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/)

#### Description:

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child `i` has a greed factor `g[i]`, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie `j` has a size `s[j]`. If `s[j] >= g[i]`, we can assign the cookie `j` to the child `i`, and the child `i` will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.



#### Understanding:




#### Approach `O(N), O(1), N: len(cookies)`:



			
#### Python - pass by reference:
```python
class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, kids: List[int], cookies: List[int]) -> int:
        
        """
        sort two arr
        traverse through the cookie arr
        as long as we have not fed the last kid (res < len(kdis); here we use res as kids arr's indexing)
        we attemp to try to fed the current kid, if can feed, res += 1
        """
        
        kids.sort()
        cookies.sort()
        
        res = 0
        
        for cookie in cookies:
            
            if res < len(kids) and cookie >= kids[res]:
                res += 1
                
        return res
```
