# [27. Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)


#### Description:

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place. The relative order of the elements may be changed.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` after placing the final result in the first `k` slots of `nums`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array `in-place` with O(1) extra memory.


#### Understanding:
Remove the element when it equals to val. Return all elements left after removing all by returning the last index that goes through the whole array.


#### Brutal Force `TC O(N^2), SC O(1)`:
```python
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        """Brutal Force"""
        """Once an element equals to val, we update the nums by removing the current ele"""
        
        n = len(nums)
        i = 0
        
        while i < n:
            
            if nums[i] == val:
                for j in range(i + 1, n):
                    nums[j - 1] = nums[j]
                i -= 1
                n -= 1
                print(i, n)
            i += 1
            print("out side dup", i, n)
        print("before return", i, n)    
        return i
```

#### Two Pointers `TC O(N), SC O(1)`:
```python
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        
        #"""Same logic /similar code with previous Q/LC.26"""
        
        #"""Two Pointers - One for the return purpose, one is to scan the whole arr"""
        
        keep = 0
        
        for loop in range(len(nums)):
            
            if nums[loop] != val:
                nums[keep] = nums[loop]
                keep += 1
            
            print("af removing dups", loop, keep)
      
        return keep
```
