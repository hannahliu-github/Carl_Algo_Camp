# [383. Ransom Note](https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/)


#### Description:

Given two strings `ransomNote` and `magazine`, return true if `ransomNote` can be constructed by using the letters from `magazine` and `false` otherwise.

Each letter in `magazine` can only be used once in `ransomNote`.

#### Understanding:

Given two strs, `m` should have all chars that inside `r`.
If `r` has repeated chars, `m` should at least have the same amount of chars to return True.

#### Approach:

- Can use defauldict(int) or array (Approach similar to LC. 242) for this question
- For the container `m`, we add; For the standard `r` we deduct
- Loop through hash, if hash value/ array element is less than 0, means False else True

```python
class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        
        if len(magazine) < len(ransomNote): return False
        
        hashset = defaultdict(int)
        
        for char in magazine:
            hashset[char] += 1
        
        print(hashset)
        
        for char in ransomNote:
            hashset[char] -= 1
            
            
        for char, val in hashset.items():
            
            if val < 0: return False
            
        return True
