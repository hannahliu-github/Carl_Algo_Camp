# [344. Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)


#### Description:

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array `in-place` with `O(1)` extra memory.


#### Understanding:

Reverse the given list of string.

- Input: s = `["h","e","l","l","o"]`
- Output: `["o","l","l","e","h"]`


#### Approach `O(N) O(1)`:

- while left < right
	- update s[left], s[right]
	- update left right pointers


#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        
        left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
        
        while left < right:

            new_r, new_l = s[left], s[right]
            
            s[left] = new_l
            s[right] = new_r
            
            left += 1
            right -= 1
```
