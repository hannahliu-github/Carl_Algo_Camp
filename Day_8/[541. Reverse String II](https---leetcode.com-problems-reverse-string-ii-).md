# [541. Reverse String II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string-ii/)


#### Description:

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, reverse the first `k` characters for every `2k` characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than `k` characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than `2k` but greater than or equal to `k` characters, then reverse the first `k` characters and leave the other as original.


#### Understanding:

Given a string, for every group of s[i: i + 2k] substring, reverse the first k group. If the last group's chars are less than k, reverse them all; if they are between k to 2k, only reverse the first k chars and left the rest as they are. 

- Input: `"abcdefghijklmn", k = 3`
- Output: `"cbadefihgjklnm"`


#### Approach `O(N) O(1)`:

- loop through the whole string by using pointer `start`
	- inside the loop, define end pointer `start + k`
	- on the entire `s`, by using slicing, we only reverse `s[start : end]` and concact the rest
	- update start pointer to `start = end + k`
- return s 


#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseStr(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:

        start = 0
        while start < len(s):
            
            end = start + k
            
            s = s[:start] + s[start:end][::-1] + s[end:]
            
            start = end + k
            
        return s
```
