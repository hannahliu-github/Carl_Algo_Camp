# [122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)

#### Description:

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold `at most one` share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the `same day`.

Find and return the `maximum` profit you can achieve.


#### Understanding:

Given an array of `prices[i]` at `i` day, find the max profit by choosing the days to sell and to buy. Note you can only buy again after selling the hold as the maximum share number you can hold is 1.

	Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
	Output: 7
	Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
	Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
	Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

- We only have `1` stock
- At `prices[i]` we only have ops as buy or sell

#### Approach - Greedy `O(N), O(1), N: len(prices)`:

eg. If buy on `day i = 0` and sell on `day i = 3`

- profit will be `prices[3] - prices[0]`
- but instead of the above, we will calculate profit on a daily basics

	-  profit `+=` (prices[i] - prices[i - 1]).....(prices[1] - prices[0])

	- we will only `+=` positive profit - `Greedy`


#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        
        
        """Greedy - Carl"""
        
        res = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            res += max(0, prices[i] - prices[i - 1])
            
        return res
```
