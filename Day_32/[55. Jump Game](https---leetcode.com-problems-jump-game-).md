# [55. Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)

#### Description:

You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's `first index`, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` if you can reach the last index, or `false` otherwise.


#### Understanding:

Given an array of `jumps[i]` at `i` step, find if can jump to the last index.

	Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
	Output: false
	Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
	
	Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
	Output: true
	Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.


#### Approach - Greedy `O(N), O(1), N: len(jumps)`:



- try to jump as far as we can for each `jumps[i]`
	- update the max jump range at each `jumps[i]`
	- to see the final index is covered by the current max jump range
		- if yes, return `True`


#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        
        """Greedy - Carl"""
        
        cover = 0
        last_idx = len(nums) - 1
        
        for i, jump in enumerate(nums):
            
            cover = max(i + jump, cover)
            
            if cover >= last_idx: return True
            
        return False
```
