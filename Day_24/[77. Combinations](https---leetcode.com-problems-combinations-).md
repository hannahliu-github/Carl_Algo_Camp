# [77. Combinations](https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/)

#### Description:

Given two integers `n` and `k`, return all possible combinations of `k` numbers chosen from the range `[1, n]`.

You may return the answer in any order.


#### Understanding:

Given a range of numbers, find all combination of size k.

	Input: n = 4, k = 2
	Output: [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
	Explanation: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 total combinations.
	Note that combinations are unordered, 
	i.e., [1,2] and [2,1] are considered to be the same combination.


#### Approach `O(N*(N!/(N-k)!*k!)), O(N)<-O(N+k)`:

If not using backtrack, it will has k-size inner loops.

Backtrack process can be generalized as a tree model.

In the tree, `n` is the width and `k` is the depth.

As to find combinations, we are going to modify the search range when go down to the next level of the tree.

- Step 1: Define the backtrack funtion 
	- parameters: path, startNum
	- return: res (global) 
- Step 2: The end of recursion/backtrack
	- path.size() == k
- Step 3: Single tree level logic
	- for loop, every time start from StartNum
		- path.push_back(i)
		- backtrack(startNum + 1, path)
		- path.pop_back() 

#### Python - pass by reference:
```python
class Solution:
    def combine(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        def backtrack(num, path):
            
            if len(path) == k: return res.append(path[:])
                
            for i in range(num, n + 1):
                
                path.append(i)
                
                backtrack(i + 1, path)
                
                path.pop()
                
                
        res = []
        backtrack(1, [])
        return res
```

#### Python - recursion scope:
```python
class Solution:
    def combine(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        def backtrack(num, path):
            
            if len(path) == k: return res.append(path)
                
            for i in range(num, n + 1):
                
                backtrack(i + 1, path + [i])
                
                
        res = []
        backtrack(1, [])
        return res
```
