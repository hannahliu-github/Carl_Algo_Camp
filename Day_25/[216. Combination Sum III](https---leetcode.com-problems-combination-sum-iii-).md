# [216. Combination Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iii/)

#### Description:

Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:

- Only numbers 1 through 9 are used.
- Each number is used at most once.
Return a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.


#### Understanding:

Given numbers `1-9`, find all combinations (no repeats) of size k that sums up equivelent to target.

	Input: k = 3, n = 7
	Output: [[1,2,4]]
	Explanation:
	1 + 2 + 4 = 7
	There are no other valid combinations.


#### Approach `O(K*(9!/(9 -	K)!)), O(K): list and call stack`:

If not using backtrack, it will has 9-size inner loops.

Backtrack process can be generalized as a tree model.

In the tree, `1-9` is the width and `k` is the depth.

As to find combinations, we are going to modify the search range when go down to the next level of the tree.

- Step 1: Define the backtrack funtion 
	- parameters: path, startNum, target
	- return: res (global) 
- Step 2: The end of recursion/backtrack
	- path.size() == k and find target
	- cannot find target 
- Step 3: Single tree level logic
	- for loop, num, start from StartNum
		- path.push_back(num)
		- backtrack(num + 1, path)
		- path.pop_back() 

#### Python - pass by reference:
```python
class Solution:
    def combine(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        def backtrack(num, path):
            
            if len(path) == k: return res.append(path)
                
            for i in range(num, n + 1):
                
                backtrack(i + 1, path + [i])
                
                
        res = []
        backtrack(1, [])
        return res
```
