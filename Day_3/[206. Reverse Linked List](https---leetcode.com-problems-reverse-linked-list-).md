# [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)


#### Description:

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.


#### Understanding:

Given a LL, reverse it and return.

#### Approach:

For each node, we switch its pointer 180 degree and let it points to left/prev.

Move the prev and cur down. When the loop ends, cur is at None so we return prev.

It is different from 头插法

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        prev, cur = None, head
 
        while cur:
            
            cnext = cur.next
            cur.next = prev
            
            prev, cur = cur, cnext
            
        return prev
```
