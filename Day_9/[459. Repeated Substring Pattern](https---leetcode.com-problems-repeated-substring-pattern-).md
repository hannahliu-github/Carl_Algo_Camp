# [459. Repeated Substring Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-substring-pattern/)


#### Description:

Given a string `s`, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together.

#### Understanding:

Check if a string is built by a substring that concatenated one or multiple times.

- Input: `s` = `"abab"`
- Output: True


#### Approach - Concatenation `O(N^2) O(N)`:

- eg. `PatternPattern`

- first, double the string 
	- `PatternPatternPatternPattern`
- cut off head and tail
	- `atternPatternPatternPattern`
- return if s in `atternPatternPatternPattern`

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def repeatedSubstringPattern(self, s: str) -> bool:
        return s in (s + s)[1: -1]
```

#### Approach - KMP `O(N) O(N)`:

Why should we even use KMP?

Refer to `LC. 28`, we use KMP firstly to find, for the whole string, what is the largest number of elements that have `prefix == suffix`, which is `arr[len(s) - 1]`.

As we know if it can return True, `arr[len(s) - 1]` can never be 0, at least it should have a `nonzero`.

So for any nonzero result we get, it indicates, there are `arr[len(s) - 1]` elements in `prefix` and also `suffix` that can make `prefix == suffix` stand.

- eg. `len(s)` = 8 and s = `'abababab'`

- `arr[7]` = 6 (Carl addressed `suffix` and `prefix` cannot contain the last and the first char)
- `prefix[0] = suffix[0]` => `s[0] = s[3]` go through `s`, we eventually can tell `s[0][1]` == `s[2][3]` == `s[4][5]` == `s[6][7]`
- we can conclude `s[0][1]` is the substring to make this question return True
- the subtring can return True when `arr[len(s) - 1] != 0` && `len(s) % (len(s) - arr[len(s) - 1])`

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def repeatedSubstringPattern(self, s: str) -> bool:
        
        n = len(s)
        
        arr = self.getNext(s, n)
        
        l = arr[n - 1]
        
        # if l(longest distance that prefix = suffix) is nonzero && n - l is a divisor of n
        return l != 0 and n % (n - l) == 0
        
        
        
    def getNext(self, s, n):
        
        arr = [0] * n
        
        j = 0
        # i from 1 as j from 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            
            while j > 0 and s[i] != s[j]:
                j = arr[j - 1]
                
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                j += 1
                
            arr[i] = j
            
        return arr
```
