# [1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string/)


#### Description:

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. A `duplicate removal` consists of choosing two `adjacent` and `equal` letters and removing them.

We repeatedly make `duplicate removals` on `s` until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It can be proven that the answer is `unique`.


#### Understanding:

Given a string, remove all characters that are adjacent or after intermediate removal, they are adjancet:


   "abbaca" -> "ca"
   "azxxzy" -> "ay"


#### Approach `O(N) O(N)`:
Stack is natually good for this type of questions.

- initilize a stack

- loop through the string
	- if stack is empty: append
	
	- else:
		- stack.pop() if stack has element and stack top is the same as the current char
		- else stack.append()
	 


#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str) -> str:
        
        stack = []
        for c in s:
            if not stack: stack.append(c)
            
            else:
                if stack and c == stack[-1]: stack.pop()
                else:
                    stack.append(c)
        
        return ''.join(stack)
```
