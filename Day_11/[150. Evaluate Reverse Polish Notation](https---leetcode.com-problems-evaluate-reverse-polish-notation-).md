# [150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/)


#### Description:

Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in `Reverse Polish Notation`.

Valid operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

`Note` that division between two integers should truncate toward zero.

It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result, and there will not be any division by zero operation.


#### Understanding:

Given a list of string, return the final answer:

- Input: tokens = `["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]`
- Output: `22`

- Explanation: `((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5`
      - = `((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5`
      - = `((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5`
      - = `((10 * 0) + 17) + 5`
      - = `(0 + 17) + 5`
      - = `17 + 5`
      - = `22`


#### Approach `O(N) O(N)`:
- This question has a tricky side when using Python
	- Python does not truncate towards 0 with division of negative results
		- eg. -121 // 7 into Python, get -18  not -17

	- we use `int(float(num1/num2))` 
		- first use `float` division to `avoid truncate toward to the smaller`
		- then we use `int()` to bring it `near to 0` 

- use `try/except` on int(char for char in s)


#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def evalRPN(self, tokens: List[str]) -> int:        
        
        stack = []
        
        for c in tokens:
            
            try:
                stack.append(int(c))
                
            except:
                num2 = stack.pop()
                num1 = stack.pop()
                
                stack.append(self.ops(num1, num2, c))
                
        return stack[0]
    
    
    def ops(self, num1, num2, op):

        if op == '+': cur = num1 + num2
        
        elif op == '-': cur = num1 - num2
        
        elif op == '*': cur = num1 * num2
            
        else: cur = int(float(num1 / num2))
            
        return cur
```
