# [93. Restore IP Addresses](https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-ip-addresses/)

#### Description:

A valid IP address consists of exactly four integers separated by single dots. Each integer is between 0 and 255 (inclusive) and cannot have leading zeros.

- For example, `"0.1.2.201"` and `"192.168.1.1"` are valid IP addresses, but `"0.011.255.245"`, `"192.168.1.312"` and `"192.168@1.1"` are invalid IP addresses.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into `s`. You are not allowed to reorder or remove any digits in `s`. You may return the valid IP addresses in any order.



#### Understanding:

Given a string, contains only numbers. Slice anyway you can to return all possible valid substring combinations.

	Input: s = "101023"
	Output: ["1.0.10.23","1.0.102.3","10.1.0.23","10.10.2.3","101.0.2.3"]


#### Approach `O(N*2^N), O(N), N: len(nums)`:

	Backtrack tree most have O(2^N) nodes. 
	Each Node will have O(N) ops on isPalindrome.

Backtrack process can be generalized as a tree model.

In the tree, the `remaining substring` is the width and `each substring` is one depth of the tree.

Because we are slicing the stirng, which means chars are not repeatable in the backtrack process, we need to have startIndex define the search range.

We only backtrack when the current substring is valid for IP address.


- Step 1: Define the backtrack funtion 

	- parameters: path (inilialize as a string), pointNum, startIndex
	- return: res (global) 
- Step 2: The end of recursion/backtrack
	- pointNum == 3
	
- Step 3: Single tree level logic
	- cur substring
	- for loop, start from startIndex to len(s)
		- if isValid
			- backtrack(i + 1, path + cur_substring + '.', pointNum + 1)

#### Python - pass by reference:
```python
class Solution:
    def restoreIpAddresses(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        
        res = []
        N = len(s)
        
        def backtrack(startIndex, path, pointNum):
            
            if pointNum == 3:
                if self.isValid(s[startIndex: N]):
                    path += s[startIndex: N]
                    res.append(path[:])
                else:
                    return
                
            for i in range(startIndex, N):
                
                char = s[startIndex : i + 1]
                
                if self.isValid(char):
                    backtrack(i + 1, path + char + '.', pointNum + 1)
        
        backtrack(0, '', 0)
        return res
        
        
    def isValid(self, s):
        
        if not s: return False
        
        N = len(s)
        num = int(s)
        
        if N != 1 and s[0] == '0': return False
        
        if num > 255: return False
        
        return True
