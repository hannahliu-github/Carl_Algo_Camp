# [78. Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)

#### Description:

Given an integer array `nums` of unique elements, return all possible subsets (the power set).

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.



#### Understanding:

Given a list of numbers. Find its subsets.

	Input: nums = [1,2,3]
	Output: [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]


#### Approach `O(N*2^N), O(N), N: len(nums)`:

	Backtrack tree most have O(2^N) nodes. 
	Each Node will have O(N) ops to copy to res.

Backtrack process can be generalized as a tree model.

In the tree, the `remaining nums is the width` and `each part of nums` is one depth of the tree.

Because we are slicing the stirng, which means chars are not repeatable in the backtrack process, we need to have startIndex define the search range.

In subset questions, res append each tree node.


- Step 1: Define the backtrack funtion 

	- parameters: path, startIndex
	- return: res (global) 
- Step 2: The end of recursion/backtrack
	- when finish traversing the whole tree
	
- Step 3: Single tree level logic
	- res.append(path)
	- for loop, start from startIndex to len(s)
		- if isValid
			- path.append() 
			- backtrack(i + 1, path)
			- path.pop()
			
#### Python - pass by reference:
```python
    
class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        res = []
        N = len(nums)
        
        def backtrack(startIndex, path):
            
            res.append(path[:])
            
            for i in range(startIndex, N):
                
                path.append(nums[i])
                backtrack(i + 1, path)
                path.pop()
                
                
        backtrack(0, [])
        return res
```
