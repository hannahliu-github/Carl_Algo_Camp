# [160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)


#### Description:

Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.


#### Understanding:

Given two linked lists, return the intersection node or null if no intersection.

- If intersected, the graph looks like a battle rope
- If not, the graph looks like 2 parellel lines


#### Approach:

- If there is an intersection:
	-  they will eventually meet as we keep resetting them to the other LL's start node when the single traverse ends.

- If there is no intersection:
	-  the above design will ensure `L1` and `L2` both reach to their respective ends when finish `the 2nd interation`. The loop breaks as `L1` and `L2` are both nulls.


### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        # use pointers to loop through LL..
        l1, l2 = headA, headB
        
        while l1 != l2:
            l1 = l1.next if l1 else headB
            l2 = l2.next if l2 else headA
            
        return l1
```
