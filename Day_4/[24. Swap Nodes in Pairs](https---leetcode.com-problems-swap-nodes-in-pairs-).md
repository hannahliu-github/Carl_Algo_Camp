# [24. Swap Nodes in Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/)


#### Description:

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

#### Understanding:

Given a LL, this LL can be [].
Swap each two nodes and return. 

#### Approach:

- Initialize a dummy b/c we are going to return from the same direction of the given LL and the return is a 
	- modfication ??? why print(head) after the while loop it got modified
	- ???? 
- Initialize 2 pointers prev and cur
- while loop through LL:
	- we only swap if there are at least 2 more nodes
	- swap 
	- reset prev and cur
- return dummy.next


### Python 

```python
class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        # if dummy does not connect to head
        # tc [1] output will be []
        dummy = ListNode(-109, head)
        
        prev, cur = dummy, head
        
        while cur and cur.next:
            
            cnext = cur.next
            
            cur.next = cnext.next
            cnext.next = cur
            prev.next = cnext
            
            
            prev, cur = cur, cur.next

        return dummy.next

```
