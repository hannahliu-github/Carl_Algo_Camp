# [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)


#### Description:

Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `n-th` node from the end of the list and return its head.


#### Understanding:

Given a linked list, remove the `n-th` node from the end of the list and return the linked list.

#### Approach:

We wanna remove the n-th node from the end of the list, so we find the node at and previous to the n-th node from the end of the list

- fast pointer: 
	-  start from head
	-  first traverse - go `n` step ahead of the other two pointers
	-  seconde traverse 
		- `go len - n + 1 step` 
		-  traverse to the end and arrives at null
- slow pointer:
	-  start from head 
	-  arrives at `n-th` node from eol
- prev pointer:  
	-  start from dummy
	-  arrives at `(n - 1)-th` node from eol

- connect/remove and then return dummy.next


### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        dummy = ListNode(-109, head)
        
        pre, slow, fast = dummy, head, head
        
        for _ in range(n):
            fast = fast.next
        
        while fast:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
            pre = pre.next
            
        pre.next = slow.next
        
        return dummy.next
```
