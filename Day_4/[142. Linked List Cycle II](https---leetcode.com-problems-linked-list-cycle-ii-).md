# [142. Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)


#### Description:

Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Do not modify the linked list.


#### Understanding:

Given a cicrled or non-circled LL, find the first node that is connected.  


#### Approach:

Learnt from the master [nettee](https://blog.csdn.net/nettee/article/details/107754840)

- fast is twice speed than slow
- when fast and slow meets, distance_fast - distance_slow = 2x - x = x = slow's distance = k*circle length
- we know know slow has walked k times of the circle distance
- so if slow moves a (non circle part) steps it will arrives at the starting point of the circle
- because x + a = a + k * circle
- we let a pointer start from head, when slow and this pointer meet, it is the starting point of the circle


#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        slow, fast = head, head
        
        while fast and fast.next:
            
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            
            if slow == fast:
                
                p = head
                
                while p != slow:
                    p = p.next
                    slow = slow.next
                return slow
            
        return None
```
