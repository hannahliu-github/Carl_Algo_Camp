# [232. Implement Queue using Stacks](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)


#### Description:

Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyQueue` class:

- `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
- `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
- `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
- `boolean empty()` Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.

Notes:

- You must use `only` standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.

- Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.


#### Understanding:

Because we can `only peek/pop from top` on a stack, which means we need to     `reversely` present the queue inside the stack:

   	eg. queue = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  
    we would like the stack to be like [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]


#### Approach `Push-O(N) Pop-O(1)`:

- `void push(int x)`
	- stack.pop() `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
	- use help_stack.append() 
		- `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` -> `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
	- stack.append()
		- `[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` 

- `peek/pop from top` 
	- `stack[-1]` / `stack.pop()`


#### Python:
```python
class MyQueue:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
        self.help_stack = []

        
    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        while self.stack:
            self.help_stack.append(self.stack.pop())
        
        self.help_stack.append(x)
        
        while self.help_stack:
            self.stack.append(self.help_stack.pop())
        

    def pop(self) -> int:        
        return self.stack.pop()
    
        
    def peek(self) -> int:
        return self.stack[-1]
        

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return len(self.stack) == 0
```
